# A simple math problem!  
> In class, each student is friends with exactly six others,
and any two students have exactly two mutual friends.  
How many students are in this class?  
  
***technical specification:***  
> The program must compile the friends dictionary according to the conditions of the task.

> The key is the student's name, and the value is the sequence of names of the student's friends.  
There are no students with the same name in the class.
  
> Dictionary compilation stops as soon as the task conditions are met.

> The algorithm should not rely on a pre-determined number of students in a class.
